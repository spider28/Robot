Code description:

1. RobotController project:
   Classes folder contains all the classes we need.
   Enums folder contains all the enum classes we need.
   Documents folder contains all the explaination documents for my code.
   In the Main Program, I simulate a 10*10 map and generate the topography, topography can be generated either Manually or Randomly.
   First, put a single robot in a map, and output 2 paths for 2 different commands for this robot.
   Second, put 2 robots in a map, robot1 moves as commands1, robot2 moves as commands2, output each robot path. 

2. UnitTest project:
   Contains unit tests for regular robot movements, most of the test methods are for single robot scenario,
   the last 2 test methods are for multiple robots scenario.
   If we would like to test more robots, just add more Robots.
   JumpRobotMove.cs file is for testing "Jump" type Robot in the future.
